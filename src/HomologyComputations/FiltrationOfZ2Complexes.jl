The following type encodes a filtration of Z2 chain complexes.
    We are going to use this to compute the homology over Z2.
    Also, note that the conventions are a bit different here then in the GradedPoset type:
    * We do _not_ want to have a cell of dimension (-1) here, so the dimensions are all non-negative numbers.
    * The elements of the posets are ordered _first_ by weight and within the same weight by the dimension.
      In particular, higher-dimensional element may apear earlier if it's weigth is smaller.
    * the convention of how boundaries are reffered to is different from that in the GradedPoset type..
